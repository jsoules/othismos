Akima)\n- Waveform templates were recorded using 5 um spaced electrodes, see [Kampff lab Ultradense Survey](http://www.kampff-lab.org/ultra-dense-survey), and later subsampled to match the Neuropixels electrode spacing\n- Background noise was generated using ~1/f random noise that matches experimental neural recordings.\n- Generated by `Kilosort2\\eMouse_drift` [code available on Github] (https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort2)\n- Two sine wave periods were present in the drift (20 um amplitude) for the full recording duration (1200 s).\n\n## Recording format\n- int16 raw format (channels x time order)\n- 1200s recording was divided to various length (600s, 1200s).\n- 64 channels were divided to various sub channels (4, 16, 32, 64) at various probe locations.\n\n\n##

PAIRED_BOYDEN\n\nThis dataset was collected by Brian D. Allen from Ed Boyden's lab. The intracellular and extracellular voltages were recorded simultaneously.\nExtracellular voltages were recorded using 128 or 256 site silicon probes custom made at Boyden lab (9x9 um site dimension, 11x11 um site pitch).\n128-channel probe has 64x2 site grid pattern and 256-channel probe has 64x4 site grid pattern.\nBad or shorted sites are excluded based on the experimenter's criteria. The number of channels exported excludes the channels from bad sites. \nBursting spikes (ISI<20ms) are kept up to three successive spikes using the experimeter's burst creteria.\n\nFor more info, visit the publication website:\nhttps://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/jn.00650.2017\nAutomated in vivo patch clamp evaluation of extracellular multielectrode array spike recording capability\nBrian D. Allen, Caroline Moore-Kochlacs, Jacob Gold Bernstein, Justin Kinney, Jorg Scholvin, Luis Seoane, Chris Chronopoulos, Charlie Lamantia, Suhasa B Kodandaramaiah, Max Tegmark, and Edward S Boyden*\n\nThe raw data (.h5 format) was converted to .mda using ironclust v4.0.6 using `irc convert-h5-mda` command.\nhttps://github.com/jamesjun/ironclust\n\nA subset of the data was extracted -- 32 channels near the center of the activity, excluding the bad channels, as documented by the experimenters' annotation.\n\nThe recording conditions for each cell are listed below.\n\n```\nNeuron  Condition

   # Silicon-juxtacellular hybrid probes\n    This studyset consists of 29 paired recordings from Silicon-juxtacellular hybrid probes.     Juxtacellular electrodes are pulled from 1 mm OD 0.7 mm ID borosilicate glass and have impedances of 8-10 MOhm     when filled with 130 mM potassium acetate. These juxtacellular electrodes are glued to 32 channel silicon probes     (A1-32-Poly3, Neuronexus) using light-cure dental acrylic. Using the inter-site spacing of the silicon probe as     a visual distance guide, the tip of the juxtacellular is fixed at a distance of ~20 micrometers from the nearest silicon     probe recording site. The closest site is selected as a site in the middle (top to bottom) of an outer column of     recording sites. The close distance between the juxtacellular tip and the recording sites results in both devices     recording the same neuron at high probability. \n    \n    #  Recording ground truth data in awake behaving mice\n    Mice are placed in the head-fixed treadmill apparatus and the protective silicon elastomer is removed from the craniotomy,     the juxtacellular-silicon hybrid prove is inserted 0.1 mm into the brain, and the craniotomy is covered with silicon fluid to     prevent drying and improve stability. The probe is advanced into the brain at ~1-2 micrometers until action potentials are     observed on the juxtacellular electrode, at which point movement is ceased and data collection begins. \n    Electrical signals from the juxtacellular electrode are recorded and amplified through an analog microelectrode amplifier     (Cygnus IR-183), then digitized via an Intan RHD2000 system. Signals from the silicon probe are amplified and digitized     through the same RHD2000 system, which results in hardware synchronization of the two signals. By converting the digital     signals in the RHD2000 to analog voltage and outputting them to a digital microprocessor (CED Power1401), we calculated online     the juxtacellular spike triggered average of each channel of the extracellular electrode, and discard recordings in which the     triggered average does not contain a spike waveform on any channel.\n

SYNTH_BIONET\n\n## Synthetic groundtruth generated using Bionet simulator\n- Bionet is a neuron-based network simulator\n- Original data (4 minutes) was generated using Bionet simulator (noiseless). \n- Data was concatenated 4-fold with random noise (10 microvolts RMS) to yield 16 minutes of data.\n\n## Detailed simulation method (originally described in Jun et al, 2017, bioRxiv)\nOur biophysical simulation randomly distributed ~710 neurons within a sensing volume of the probe (200×200×600 μm), and each neuron is constructed from real morphology of various cell types. Our simulation closely matches the real recordings in terms of the spatial spread of the spike waveforms, and the identity of all units and their spike timing information are precisely determined from their simulated intracellular voltage traces. Biophysically realistic network simulations were setup in order to generate simulated ground truth extracellular depth recordings datasets. The main engine used for these biophysical simulations was NEURON version 7.4 used with custom-written python (version 2.7) wrapper-algorithms that were used to define, setup and instantiate network models and simulations as well as save output.\n\nThe network model consists of two cell types, excitatory pyramidal neurons (2,560) and inhibitory basket cells (640). Pyramidal single-neuron models used in our network were published by Hay and co-workers as part of their study on models capturing a wide range of dendritic and perisomatic active properties. These single-neuron models were shown to capture a number of intracellular characteristics such as backpropagating action potentials, dendritic Calcium electrogenesis, etc. In addition, a later study showed that these computational models accurately capture the extracellular signature of neocortical pyramidal neurons. We adopted inhibitory basket cell models from Hu et al. (2010) who developed these models to capture a number of features such as backpropagation and dendritic Na/K ratio. Notably, pyramidal and basket cell models had active dendrites, a feature critical for capturing extracellular spiking activity. Each neuron received external excitatory synaptic input emulating AMPA synapses. The number and timing of these external synaptic inputs was set such as to reach specific spike frequency output.\n\nWith regards to calculating the simulated extracellular recordings, the so-called line source approximation was used to estimate the extracellular voltage at various locations assuming a perfectly homogeneous, isotropic and purely resistive (0.3 S/m) extracellular space. Specifically, the Neuropixels probe electrode location was adopted from layout specifications. Network simulations were performed at the San Diego supercomputer facility via the NSG (neuroscience gateway) portal. \n\n## Studies contained \n- `bionet_static`\n  - No drift was added. Electrode spacing: 60 channels spaced 20 um vertically and 28 um horizontally. \n  - Four electrode layouts used: two columns (two layouts) and four staggered columns (two layout)\n\n- `bionet_drift`\n  - Uniform drift was added by translating 16 micrometers over the duration of the recording (16 minutes).\n  - Drift was generated at 0.5 um (32 steps) resolution by interpolating 5 um spaced electrodes with a 2D Gaussian kernel.\n\n- `bionet_shuffle`\n  - Random jumping drift was added by dividing the drifting dataset to 32 time segments and shuffling in time.\n\n##

For each case, 5 different simulations were performed.\n\nThe data associated with each simulation is stored in the variable data located in the file ‘simulation_sim-num.mat’, where sim-num represents the simulation number (from1 to 95). The sampling rate is 24 KHz. \n\nAll the information regarding to the ground truth of the recording is stored in 3 cell arrays located in the file ‘ground_truth.mat’. The details associated to the simulation sim-num are stored in the sim-num-th row of each cell array. Particularly, it includes details of the waveform, class (single unit label or multiunit) and time in the recording, corresponding to each of the spikes included in the simulation.\n\nVariable su_waveforms{sim-num} stores the waveforms of each single unit used in the simulation. Each waveform has 316 points and it is sampled at 96 KHz (the original sampling rate used to create the neural recording before downsampling it to 24Khz).\n\nVariable spike_classes{sim-num} is a vector where the i-th component represents the class associated to the i-th spike in the simulation. It takes values between 0 and tot_SU (the total number of single units included in the simulation, which can be from 2 to 20). Class 0 is associated to the multiunit activity. Each single unit is associated to a waveform stored in su_waveforms{sim-num}.\n\nVariable spike_first_sample{sim-num} is a vector where the i-th component represents the first sample in the recording where the i-th spike in the simulation was inserted (which is associated to the waveform from the class number in the i-th component of spike_classes{sim-num}).\n\n## Recording format\n- single channel\n- float32 format (1 channel x time order)\n- 600s recording duration\n- Negative-going polarity (sign was flipped from the original recording supplied by the authors)\n\n\n## References\n- Pedreira C, Martinez J, Ison MJ, Quian Quiroga R.
