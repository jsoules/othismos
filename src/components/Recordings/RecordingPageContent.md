# Recordings

## Recording Organization

Recordings are grouped into "studies." Each study contains a set of real or synthesized
recordings sharing a common source (probe and brain region, or simulation code
settings). It is appropriate to aggregate the statistics from all recordings within a
particular study.

In turn, studies are grouped into "study sets." Each study set is a collection of studies
which have different parameters but share some common features.

## Recording Types

Our hosted recordings include many popular probe geometries and types, and fall
into three cartegories:

1. **Paired (*in vivo* or *in vitro*)** Recordings from various laboratories
where an independent intra- or juxta-cellular probe providers reliable ground
truth firing events, usually for one neuron per recording.
1. **Simulated (*in silico*)** Recordings from neural simulator codes with
various degrees of fidelity, with known firing events for large numbers of
neurons.
1. **Human-curated** We also host a small set of expert human-curated sorting results.
