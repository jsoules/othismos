We have many future plans, and welcome your
suggestions. Some of our future plans include:

1. Expanding the set of test recordings
1. Parameter settings: more explicit control of
parameters for sorting algorithms, with possible
optimization.
1. Hybrid recordings: incorporate a new recording
class to complement the current *in vivo*,
*ex vivo*, and simulated recordings.
1. Expansion of SNR to other surrogate quality
metrics: display noise overlap, isolation, etc, as
used in MountainView.
1. Stability-based quality metrics: run sorters
multiple times to measure stability, as in our
work "Validation of neural spike sorting
algorithms without ground-truth information," A.

1. Further integration with SpikeInterface.
