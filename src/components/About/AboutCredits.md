SpikeForest is a project of the
[Flatiron Institute](https://flatironinstitute.org)
involving the
[Center for Computational Mathematics (CCM)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/)
and the
[Scientific Computing Core (SCC)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/scientific-computing-core/).

* Jeremy Magland, CCM (chief infrastructure
developer, backend analysis framework)
* James Jun, CCM (infrastructure, testing, recording
preparation, and algorithm integration)
* Elizabeth Lovero, SCC (site design, web development, visualizations)
* Leslie Greengard, CCM (concept, planning)
* Alex Barnett, CCM (concept, planning, site design, testing)  

&nbsp;

Other key contributors to the project include:

* Alex Morley - Mozilla Fellow, MRC Brain Network
Dynamics Unit, University of Oxford, UK
(infrastructure, testing)
* Witold Wysota - Warsaw, Poland (infrastructure, testing)

&nbsp;

File format conversions and some computations make
use of [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/).
Over time we will expand our integration with this
project. It is under development by the following
individuals:

* Cole Hurwitz - The Institute for Adaptive and
Neural Computation (ANC), University of Edinburgh,
Edinburgh, Scotland
* Alessio Paolo Buccino - Center for Inegrative
Neurolasticity (CINPLA), Department of
Biosciences, Physics, and Informatics, University
of Oslo, Oslo, Norway
* Matthias Hennig - The Institute for Adaptive and
Neural Computation (ANC), University of Edinburgh,
Edinburgh, Scotland
* Samuel Garcia - Centre de Recherche en
Neuroscience de Lyon (CRNL), Lyon, France
* Jeremy Magland - Center for Computational
Mathematics, Flatiron Institute, New York, NY
