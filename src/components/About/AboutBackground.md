This project is the fruition of a long-term goal
within the spike sorting effort of CCM, starting in
2014 at what was then SCDA (the Simons Center for
Data Analysis). The original spike sorting effort
comprised Jeremy Magland, Alex Barnett, and Leslie
Greengard, and collaborators in Loren Frank's lab.

Design principles were outlined in our
[white paper](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/spikesortercomparison)
of May 2018. This was inspired in part by a
community discussion on validation at the Janelia
spike sorting workshop of 3/22/18.

We were influenced (in terms of concept, features,
and site design) by many neuroscience and
non-neuroscience algorithm validation websites,
including:

* [ClustEval website](https://clusteval.sdu.dk/)
for comparing clustering algorithms, including
parameter optimizations. Their publication is:
Wiwie, C., RÃ¶ttger, R. & Baumbach, J. "Comparing
the performance of biomedical clustering methods,"
Nature Methods (2015).
* [NeuroFinder](http://neurofinder.codeneuro.org/)
by Jeremy Freeman, for calcium imaging spatial
neuron extraction comparison.
* [SpikeFinder](http://spikefinder.codeneuro.org), by P. Berens,
for extracting spikes from calcium
imaging fluorescence curves.
* [G-Node](http://spike.g-node.org). A now-defunct 2011-2012 project
where the user
uploads sorted data, which is compared against a
hidden ground truth sorting and optionally
published.
* [cortexlab](http://phy.cortexlab.net/data/sortingComparison), by
N. Steinmetz. Comparison of several algorithms on hybrid data.
